# Traffic-Light-Controller
In this Project, a sophisticated traffic light controller  was developed using Verilog and was implemented on an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) platform. The primary aim was to simulate a realistic traffic management system, employing a Moore state machine design paradigm.
This project was part of the digital circuit design course at KFUPM.
